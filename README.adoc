== Flightpanel DCS-BIOS

DCS-BIOS is a `Export.lua` file for use with http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/[DCS: World].
It provides a stable, documented interface for external hardware and software to interact with the clickable cockpit of a DCS: World aircraft.

This Version is a fork of the older Version of https://github.com/dcs-bios/dcs-bios[DCS-BIOS] created and programmed by https://github.com/jboecker[jboecker]
We have this older Version improved and updated to meet todays state of DCS: World

This Version is not only for Flightpanels, its like the normal DCS-BIOS version before the BIOS-HUB versions.
Works also for Pit Builders and Arduino users!

  If want to support us, You find infos at the bottom of this page!
  With that money, we buy the planes to integrade them in Flightpanel DCS-BIOS fork.

- Release/Prerelease are mostly for the stable version of DCS.
- DCS Beta Users should use the master branch of the fork. _(Start a Flight before Programming to update the json Files)_
- Arduino Users should download the `Source code(zip)` on the Release page to get all needed files
- Flightpanel users download the `DCS-BIOS_0.7.XXX.zip`

Problems/Infos see our Wiki: https://github.com/DCSFlightpanels/DCSFlightpanels/wiki[DCS-Flightpanel/DCSBIOS Wiki]

== For Panel Builders

You don't need to be a programmer or electrical engineer.
The link:Scripts/DCS-BIOS/doc/userguide.{link-ext}[DCS-BIOS User Guide] will show you step by step how to connect your panel to DCS using DCS-BIOS and the beginner-friendly http://arduino.cc[Arduino microcontroller platform].
You don't have to write any program code yourself.

== For Software Developers

The link:Scripts/DCS-BIOS/doc/developerguide.{link-ext}[Developer Guide] explains how to connect to and interpret the DCS-BIOS export data stream and how to send commands to DCS-BIOS to operate controls inside the cockpit.

== Is My Aircraft Supported?

  Use always the latest version of the Mods!

  For DCS Flightpanels:
  FC3 are only supported with Keyemulator. But some Exports can made as Strings (FC3.lua) and CommonData

If you want to add support for another module, please get in touch.(see below)

== Mod Support

If you want to add a FC3 based Mod (eg. VSN_Mod Planes) for commondata suport, you must follow
these instructions:

Add at the bottom  in \DCS-BIOS\lib\AircraftList.lua

a("PlaneName", false)

To get the correct Plane Name, open the control-reference page while you fly that plane.
In MetadataStat you find the Plane Name.

== For setting up the Control-reference Page:

1. Install Google Chrome
2. Copy in the AddressBar `chrome://extensions/`, check "Developer mode" top right corner.
3. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and choose your "C:\Users\<username>\Saved Games\DCS\Scripts\DCS-BIOS\doc" folder
4. A new extension "DCS-BIOS Control Reference Live Preview"
   will be visible under "Apps". `chrome://apps/`
5. Exit "Settings"
6. Start DCS, load a Mission and jump in a Plane
7. Click "Apps" in your Browser. Your DCS-BIOS extension be there. From there you can see the controls change as you fly and manipulate the cockpit.

  Remember to hit the Refresh Button after you restart/change a mission, so Chrome gets a new connection to DCS-BIOS.

== socat

There are 2 socat versions, 32 and 64 bit. Choose that version that fits best for you.
The files in the zip File must be unzipped direct in the socat folder.

  The path must be: /socat/socat.exe
